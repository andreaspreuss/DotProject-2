DotProject - Opportunities

This mod was developed by Christian Kien (c.kien@eif.org) for the EIF (www.eif.org) in cooperation with Josï¿½ Grincho (j.grincho@eif.org).

"opportunities" module - in our project management methodology, we wanted to be sure that we capture ideas and/or issues which in some 
cases may turn into a project and in some other cases may just become a "process", a working group or, in the worst case, be abandoned. 
This module allows us to capture opportunities, to qualify them, attribute them a status, indicate or not related projects and to fill in 
information to produce an opportunity charter. 

It does NOT touch the existing dotProject or modules in any way, so there is NO danger of loosing any data!
If you uninstall the opportunities-mod, it will drop the table "opportunities" with the stored information ("previous" and "next").
After installation, the information can be entered/updated or deleted through the link "Opportunities" or through a tab in project view.
 
Installation:

As all the other modules for DotProject.  
head to the "System Admin" view of DotProject and click install, disable (to enable) and last but least 
change its status from hidden to visible. That's all.
