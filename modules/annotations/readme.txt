DotProject - Annotations
 
This mod was developed by Christian Kien (c.kien@eif.org) for the EIF (www.eif.org) in cooperation with Josï¿½ Grincho (j.grincho@eif.org).
 
Annotations was made to have some additional information on projects on a daily basis which is necessary for status reporting purposes. In
detail, there is a monthly report (kind of excel table) where these information are listed (for every workday of a month).
One can add two separate information (called "previous" and "next") to the various projects at different dates.

It does NOT touch the existing dotProject or modules in any way, so there is NO danger of loosing any data!
If you uninstall the annotations-mod, it will drop the table "annotations" with the stored information ("previous" and "next").
After installation, the information can be entered/updated or deleted through the link "Annotations" or through a tab in project view.
 
Installation:

As all the other modules for DotProject.  
head to the "System Admin" view of DotProject and click install, disable (to enable) and last but least 
change its status from hidden to visible. That's all.
